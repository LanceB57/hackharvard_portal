## Setup

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Changes

```bash
git checkout -B branch_name
```

The `branch_name` should be concise but descriptive. E.g., if making a page for profile settings, a possible branch name is `profile_settings`.

After finishing a feature, create a pull request. Never commit directly to the main branch.
